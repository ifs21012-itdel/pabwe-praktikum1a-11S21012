        <h2>The OSI 7 Layers</h2>

        <p>
          We’ll describe OSI layers “top down” from the application layer that
          directly serves the end user, down to the physical layer.
        </p>
      </header>

      <h3>7. Application Layer</h3>
      <p>
        The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers
        and email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and
        receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples
        of application layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple
        Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).
      </p>

      <h3>6. Presentation Layer</h3>
      <p>
        The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It
        defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it
        is received correctly on the other end. The presentation layer takes any
        data transmitted by the application layer and prepares it for
        transmission over the session layer.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Session Layer</h3>
      <p>
        The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions,
        between devices. It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they
        remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing
        them when communication ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints
        during a data transfer—if the session is interrupted, devices can resume
        data transfer from the last checkpoint.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Transport Layer</h3>
      <p>
        The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and
        breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end. It is responsible for
        reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into
        data that can be used by the session layer. The transport layer carries
        out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the connection
        speed of the receiving device, and error control, checking if data was
        received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Network Layer</h3>
      <p>
        The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments
        into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end.
        The other is routing packets by discovering the best path across a
        physical network. The network layer uses network addresses (typically
        Internet Protocol addresses) to route packets to a destination node.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Data Link Layer</h3>
      <p>
        The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two
        physically-connected nodes on a network. It breaks up packets into
        frames and sends them from source to destination. This layer is composed
        of two parts—Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network
        protocols, performs error checking and synchronizes frames, and Media
        Access Control (MAC) which uses MAC addresses to connect devices and
        define permissions to transmit and receive data.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Physical Layer</h3>
      <p>
        The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless
        connection between network nodes. It defines the connector, the
        electrical cable or wireless technology connecting the devices, and is
        responsible for transmission of the raw data, which is simply a series
        of 0s and 1s, while taking care of bit rate control.
